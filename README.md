# Degarbayan-SC: A Colloquial Paraphrase Farsi Subtitles Dataset
Paraphrase generation and paraphrase detection are important tasks in Natural Language Processing (NLP), such as information retrieval, text simplification, question answering, and chatbots. The lack of comprehensive datasets in the Persian paraphrase is a major obstacle to progress in this area. In spite of their importance, no large-scale corpus has been made available so far, given the difficulties in its creation and the intensive labor required. In this paper, the construction process of Degarbayan-SC using movie subtitles. As you know, movie subtitles are in Colloquial language. It is different from formal language.  To the best of our knowledge, Degarbayan-SC is the first freely released large-scale (in the order of a million words) Persian paraphrase corpus. Furthermore, this newly introduced dataset will help the growth of Persian paraphrase.
